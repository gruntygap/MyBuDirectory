                Hello once again,
                A decent update to the site, it now does something. Not only can you look up your bethel compa√±eros, but
                you can also post to the bulletin board. The new feature is avaliable in the comments tab. Simply press,
                "new post", then proceed to enter your name that you want to be referenced as, then enter whatever the
                frick you want! Eventually I plan to move this towards a user system, as well as including richer
                content. (if someone enters a link, it will pull up a picture etc.) For now this is what you get.
                Remember to make suggestions, or report bugs within this new feature! <strong>You can report comments on
                the help tab</strong>
            </p>

                Hello,
                Small Update to the Site today, I have added a couple new pages. We have a login page, however this is
                not a working page at all; you can click on it just cause, otherwise ignore it. I also added a comments
                page, you can view it by clicking, however this is also non functioning. <strong>However,</strong> I
                have now added something semi useful. A HELP PAGE. Now you and your friends can contact me for bugs,
                suggestions, or other issues/comments. So that's all. Maybe one day this site will have a purpose.
            </p>

                Welcome to the site! Wow this is getting repetitive. Anyhow, the site is intended for a few different
                tools I am developing. The tools are still in progress, and can hardly be tested. The website will
                eventually be updated to a point to where people can contact me, or give suggestions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Peace, GG
