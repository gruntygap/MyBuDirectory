                Hello,
                Small Update to the Site today, I have added a couple new pages. We have a login page, however this is
                not a working page at all; you can click on it just cause, otherwise ignore it. I also added a comments
                page, you can view it by clicking, however this is also non functioning. <strong>However,</strong> I
                have now added something semi useful. A HELP PAGE. Now you and your friends can contact me for bugs,
                suggestions, or other issues/comments. So that's all. Maybe one day this site will have a purpose.
            </p>

                Tis Lit, GG

                Welcome to the site! Wow this is getting repetitive. Anyhow, the site is intended for a few different
                tools I am developing. The tools are still in progress, and can hardly be tested. The website will
                eventually be updated to a point to where people can contact me, or give suggestions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Peace, GG
